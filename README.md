<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3 align="center">Intake</h3>
<br />
<p> 
       The ticket intake stage is where a request is submitted to the system which can happen through the web portal, via email, or manually by an agent. The system creates a ticket ID that is unique and collects the users input on the issue type, subject, and department. So in this example the user named Ken creates a ticket

<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Tickets are usually routed based on predetermined help topics or manually assigned to departments and agents.

<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  The start of communication begins with the end-user explaining the issue or clicking which category best fits the problem they are having. After this based on the company and the priority level an SLA (Service Level Agreement) timer may start counting down. Agent john Doe will be the one to work the ticket. Agent John sees the priority level of the ticket (Sev-A emergency ticket) and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.

<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe then logs in:

</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Once the issue is resolved, the agent john submits a final reply and marks the ticket as 'Resolved' or 'Closed'. The user may receive a notification or satisfaction surveySupport agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed.

</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
